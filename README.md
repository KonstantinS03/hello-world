# hello-world
Hello world of GitHub. My name is Konstantin S and I am very excited to join this community and work on some amazing projects in the future.

I am looking to learn more about coding and programming and hope this code hosting platform will help me do so. I am part of Team 2068 in the First Robotics Competition (FRC) and am part of the programming team. I hope this program will help me and my fellow teammates work more quickly and more efficiently with one another :)
